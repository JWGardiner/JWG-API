# JWG-API
Some code I use often.

The code in this involves shortening code, so for example, writing a file would only be 1 line rather than 5, this saves you time, as it's easier to remember 1 line of code, rather than 5.

# Documentation

Go to the Wiki at the top to get Documentation.

No support is provided as this project is something I don't expect to be used outside of my own projects, and I build onto it as such.
