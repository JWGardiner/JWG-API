# JWG-API
Some code I use often.

The code in this involves shortening code, so for example, writing a file would only be 1 line rather than 5, this saves you time, as it's easier to remember 1 line of code, rather than 5.

**No support provided**; this code is mostly just for my projects, you're free to use it, but no official support will be given, there is documentation (see below) that goes quite in depth so you shouldn't need official support; but bug reports etc will likely not be fixed.

# Documentation

Go to the Wiki at the top to get Documentation.

No support is provided as this project is something I don't expect to be used outside of my own projects, and I build onto it as such; however you are free to ask for features.
